## Welcome to toyAPL (WIP)!

ToyAPL implements the basic features of APL\360 and a few things from APL.SV (the format and execute functions). I am a C programmer with no APL experience. This implementation is my attempt to learn APL while also trying to examine it with the implementers' eye. So, obviously it is na√Øve and inefficient in many ways, but, as is often said, the journey is more important than the destination.

I am aware of other implementations with available source code (e.g. GNU APL), but examining these implementations would deprive me of the joys of discovery and of making my own mistakes so I have not looked at them.

This is still work in progress.

## Platforms

The goal is to make it available on macOS, Linux and Windows but for now it is building only on macOS.

## Unicode

All terminal input/output is done using UTF-8. This is made easier on macOS by using Dyalog's Alt keyboard driver, which provides easy typing for all APL characters using Alt and Alt-Shift keys. During input, the Unicode characters are mapped to byte tokens but strings retain their UTF-8 encoding.

## The function editor

## Limitations

## Not implemented

## Future work

* Use of 16-bit UTF-16 Unicode characters for strings
* Better handling of floating-point comparison and division
* Implement internal integer datatype (currently only FP)
* Nested arrays
* D-fns
* A C++ rewrite
